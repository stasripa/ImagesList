# ImagesList

## Install and run
To run the project simple do `npm install` and `react-native run-android`.
PS: Didn't even try on iOS because i'm working on windows machine and  all i have to work with iOS is an old mac mini and it takes time to do anything on it. I apologize.

## Work description
There are 2 branches: '3hrs' and 'master'. 3hrs branch contains result of 3 hours work: API requests, images list with continues loading, image details (with author and camera displaying), sharing, pan and zoom. master branch contains all from 3hrs branch plus API error handling, photo filters, image details activity indicator. This changes from master branch took for me additional 2,5 hours.
